            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
            <span>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</span><br>
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>
            <span>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</span>
